            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors
                came around to commiserate. They said,
            </p>
            <q class="villagerQuote">
                We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.
            </q>
            <p>
                The farmer said,
            </p>
            <q class="farmerQuote">
                <em>Maybe.</em>
            </q>
            <p>
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody
                came back and said,
            </p>
            <q class="villagerQuote">
                Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!
            </q>
            <p>
                The farmer again said,
            </p>
            <q class="farmerQuote">
                <em>Maybe.</em>
            </q>.
            <p>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and
                broke his leg.
                The neighbors then said,
            </p>
            <q class="villagerQuote">
                Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>
            </q>
            <p>
                , and the farmer responded,
            </p>
            <q class="farmerQuote">
                <em>Maybe.</em>
            </q>
            <p>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript
                people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
                Again all the neighbors came around and said,
            </p>
            <q class="villagerQuote">
                Isn’t that great! Again
            </q>
            <p>
                he said,
            </p>
            <q class="farmerQuote">
                <em>Maybe.</em>
            </q>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
                    impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or
                    <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
                    misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span>
                    fortune.

                <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas
                are
                <span class="good">good</span> for
                monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's
                not
                make a big deal out of it...
